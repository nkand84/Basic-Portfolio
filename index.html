            <p> Hello World! I am Nitya Kandukuri, a Web Developer living in sunny San Diego, California. I graduated with a Masters' Degree in Computer Engineering from the University of North Texas. I have had the oppurtunity to work as a Web Developer at the Electrical Engineering Department, Univeristy of North Texas. </p>
            <p>
            The passion for web development happened by taking my favourite course, "Human Computer Interfaces". One thing led to another and I landed my first job as a part-time junior web developer at my university. These fortunate turn of events has sparked my inner interest towards Web development. After my graduation, I was offered a full-time web developer position at the Electrical Engineering department, UNT. I was actively involved from the start to finish of the architecture of the project with the amazing Central Web Maintenance Team at UNT.</p> 
            <p>Currenlty, I am enrolled in the UCSD Web Development Bootcamp Program where I am enhancing my skillset to master full stack web development. 
            </p>
        <p>In my free time, I love spending family time with my wonderful husband and the love of my life, my daughter. I also enjoy shopping, hiking, photography, drawing, and painting... Go Figure!</p>
